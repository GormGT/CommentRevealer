# CommentRevealer

A script that reveals HTML-comments on a webpage. Originally made for revealing comments hidden in articles on [TDWTF](https://thedailywtf.com/), though should work on just about all websites. Just don't expect sites with dozens of comments to look pretty once comments are displayed.

Originally made as a chrome-snippet, hence why it's all in one file.
